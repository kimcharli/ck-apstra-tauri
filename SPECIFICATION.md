# Technical Specification: Apstra Network Configuration Tool

## 1. Project Overview

### Purpose
A Tauri-based desktop application for processing Excel spreadsheets containing network configuration data and performing automated actions on Apstra network infrastructure.

### Goals
- Streamline network configuration data processing workflows
- Provide intuitive Excel-to-network-action pipeline
- Ensure data validation and error handling throughout the process
- Support real-time progress tracking and comprehensive reporting
- Provide comprehensive logging and post-mortem analysis capabilities
- Enable direct integration with Apstra REST API for system search and management

### Scope
Phase-based development of a cross-platform desktop application with web technologies frontend and Rust backend for robust file processing and system integration.

## 2. System Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React/Vue.js with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Rust with Tauri framework
- **File Processing**: Rust-based Excel parsing with `calamine` or `xlsxwriter`
- **UI Framework**: Modern CSS framework (Tailwind CSS recommended)
- **Build System**: Vite for frontend, Cargo for Rust backend

### Architecture Decisions

#### 2.1 Tauri Framework Rationale
- Cross-platform desktop deployment
- Secure file system access
- Performance benefits of Rust backend
- Small application bundle size
- Web frontend flexibility

#### 2.2 Data Flow Architecture
```
Excel Upload → Temp Storage → Sheet Selection → Data Parsing → Validation → Table Display → Action Selection → Processing → Results
```

#### 2.3 Two-Phase Processing Pattern
Based on lessons from related projects, the system implements a proven two-phase approach:

**Phase 1: Data Validation & Review**
- Upload and temporary storage
- Sheet selection and header mapping
- Data parsing with field normalization
- Validation and duplicate detection
- Interactive table display for user review

**Phase 2: Action Execution**
- User-selected action processing
- Real-time progress tracking
- Comprehensive error handling
- Results reporting and cleanup

This separation prevents processing failures and provides user control over the workflow.
