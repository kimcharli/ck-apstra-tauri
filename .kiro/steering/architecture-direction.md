# Architecture Direction: Domain-Driven Development

## Strategic Direction

The Apstra Network Configuration Tool is transitioning from a technical-layer organization to a **domain-driven architecture** to improve maintainability, developer experience, and system scalability.

## Why Domain-Driven Architecture?

### Current Challenges
- **Mixed Organizational Patterns**: Some code organized by feature, some by technical layer
- **Cross-Language Inconsistency**: Frontend and backend don't mirror each other's structure
- **Scattered Functionality**: Related code spread across multiple directories
- **Developer Friction**: Time-consuming to locate and modify related functionality

### Expected Benefits
- **50% Faster Development**: Reduce time to locate related functionality
- **Improved Maintainability**: Clear domain boundaries reduce coupling
- **Better Onboarding**: New developers understand organization within 1 day
- **Enhanced Type Safety**: Centralized API contracts prevent integration errors
- **Scalable Growth**: New features fit naturally into domain structure

## Domain Boundaries

### Core Business Domains

#### 1. Excel Domain
- **Purpose**: File processing, parsing, sheet selection, data extraction
- **Components**: FileUpload, SheetSelector, Excel validation
- **Services**: Excel parsing, file handling, data extraction
- **Key Types**: ExcelFile, ExcelSheet, ExcelRow, ValidationResult

#### 2. Apstra Domain  
- **Purpose**: API integration, authentication, system management
- **Components**: ApstraConfigManager, ToolsPage, authentication UI
- **Services**: API client, session management, system search
- **Key Types**: ApstraConfig, AuthResult, SystemSearchResult, QueryResult

#### 3. Conversion Domain
- **Purpose**: Header mapping, data transformation, validation rules
- **Components**: ConversionMapManager, mapping configuration UI
- **Services**: Enhanced conversion, transformation engine, validation
- **Key Types**: ConversionMap, FieldDefinition, TransformationRule, MappingResult

#### 4. Provisioning Domain
- **Purpose**: Network configuration, workflow management, data processing
- **Components**: ProvisioningPage, ProvisioningTable, workflow UI
- **Services**: Network configuration, action processing, workflow management
- **Key Types**: NetworkConfigRow, ProcessingResult, ProvisioningEntry

#### 5. Shared Domain
- **Purpose**: Common utilities, types, and cross-domain functionality
- **Components**: Reusable UI components, common hooks
- **Services**: Logging, error handling, shared utilities
- **Key Types**: Common interfaces, error types, shared data structures

## Implementation Strategy

### Migration Phases

#### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- Create domain directory structure in both frontend and backend
- Set up module exports and build configuration
- Establish shared type contracts and API definitions

#### Phase 2: Core Domain Migration (Weeks 3-6)
- Migrate Excel domain (file processing foundation)
- Migrate Apstra domain (API integration core)
- Migrate Conversion domain (data transformation engine)

#### Phase 3: Workflow Domain Migration (Weeks 7-8)
- Migrate Provisioning domain (main application workflow)
- Organize shared utilities and infrastructure code
- Update application-level organization

#### Phase 4: Cleanup and Optimization (Weeks 9-10)
- Remove legacy directory structure
- Update documentation and development tooling
- Validate all functionality and optimize build processes

### Risk Mitigation
- **Incremental Migration**: Each domain migrated independently
- **Parallel Structure**: New structure created alongside existing code
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Full test coverage maintained throughout migration
- **Rollback Capability**: Legacy structure preserved until migration validated

## Development Guidelines

### During Migration Period

#### For New Features
- Follow domain-driven patterns when creating new functionality
- Place new code in appropriate domain directories when possible
- Use domain-specific services and type definitions
- Write tests following domain-specific organization

#### For Existing Code Modifications
- Consider domain migration opportunities when modifying existing code
- Update import paths to use domain-specific modules when available
- Refactor toward domain boundaries when making significant changes
- Maintain backward compatibility during transition period

#### For Import Paths
- Prefer domain-specific imports over legacy technical-layer imports
- Use shared domain utilities for cross-domain functionality
- Follow updated documentation for current import patterns
- Expect import path changes during active migration phases

### Post-Migration Standards

#### Domain Isolation
- Minimize dependencies between domains
- Use shared domain for cross-domain functionality
- Avoid circular dependencies through careful interface design
- Keep domain-specific logic within domain boundaries

#### Naming Conventions
- **Domains**: Singular nouns (excel, apstra, conversion, provisioning)
- **Services**: End with "Service" (ExcelProcessingService, ApstraApiService)
- **Commands**: Use domain prefix (excel::upload_file, apstra::authenticate)
- **Types**: Descriptive names indicating domain (ExcelRow, ApstraConfig)

#### Testing Organization
- Domain-specific test directories and utilities
- Cross-domain integration tests in dedicated directories
- Shared test utilities for common testing patterns
- Clear test boundaries matching domain boundaries

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Goals
- **Developer Velocity**: 50% reduction in time to locate related functionality
- **Code Maintainability**: 30% reduction in cross-module dependencies
- **Type Safety**: 100% type coverage for frontend-backend API contracts
- **Build Performance**: Maintain or improve current build times

### Qualitative Goals
- **Developer Experience**: Intuitive code organization and navigation
- **System Understanding**: Clear mental model of system architecture
- **Feature Development**: Natural fit for new features within domain structure
- **Maintenance Efficiency**: Easier debugging and issue resolution

## Documentation and Resources

### Key Documents
- **Complete Specification**: `.kiro/specs/file-structure-improvements/`
- **Requirements**: Detailed user stories and acceptance criteria
- **Design**: Technical architecture and implementation patterns
- **Tasks**: Step-by-step implementation plan with dependencies

### Migration Support
- **Migration Guides**: Step-by-step instructions for developers
- **Import Path Updates**: Documentation of changing import patterns
- **Domain APIs**: Interface documentation for each domain
- **Testing Patterns**: Updated testing strategies and utilities

This architectural direction represents a strategic investment in long-term maintainability and developer productivity. The domain-driven approach aligns with industry best practices and will position the codebase for sustainable growth and evolution.
