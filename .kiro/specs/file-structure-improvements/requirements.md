# Requirements Document: File Structure Improvements

## Introduction

This specification addresses structural improvements to better align the JavaScript/TypeScript frontend and Rust backend modules in the Apstra Network Configuration Tool. The current structure has evolved organically and shows several misalignments that impact maintainability, discoverability, and development efficiency.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Domain-Driven Module Organization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase organized by business domains rather than technical layers, so that I can quickly locate all related functionality for a specific feature.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN organizing modules THEN both frontend and backend SHALL follow consistent domain boundaries
2. WHEN a developer needs to work on Excel processing THEN all related files SHALL be co-located in both frontend and backend
3. WHEN adding new features THEN the domain structure SHALL provide clear guidance on file placement
4. IF a domain spans multiple technical concerns THEN the structure SHALL maintain clear separation within the domain

### Requirement 2: Consistent Naming Conventions Across Languages

**User Story:** As a developer working across frontend and backend, I want consistent naming patterns so that I can easily map between TypeScript and Rust implementations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a service exists in both frontend and backend THEN the naming SHALL follow predictable patterns
2. WHEN types/models are shared concepts THEN they SHALL have corresponding names in both languages
3. WHEN commands bridge frontend-backend THEN the naming SHALL clearly indicate the domain and operation
4. IF naming conventions differ due to language idioms THEN there SHALL be clear documentation of the mapping

### Requirement 3: Eliminate Structural Duplication and Inconsistencies

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to avoid confusion from inconsistent file organization so that I can focus on business logic rather than navigating structural inconsistencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN similar functionality exists in both languages THEN the file organization SHALL mirror each other
2. WHEN deprecated patterns exist THEN they SHALL be clearly marked or removed
3. WHEN new patterns are introduced THEN they SHALL be consistently applied across both codebases
4. IF structural differences are necessary THEN they SHALL be documented with clear rationale

### Requirement 4: Improved Service Layer Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clear service layer architecture so that business logic is properly encapsulated and reusable across components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN business logic is needed THEN it SHALL be encapsulated in domain-specific services
2. WHEN services interact with external systems THEN they SHALL have clear boundaries and interfaces
3. WHEN frontend components need backend functionality THEN they SHALL go through well-defined service layers
4. IF services have dependencies THEN the dependency graph SHALL be clear and avoid circular references

### Requirement 5: Enhanced Type Safety and API Contracts

**User Story:** As a developer, I want strong type safety between frontend and backend so that integration errors are caught at compile time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN data crosses the frontend-backend boundary THEN types SHALL be automatically synchronized
2. WHEN API contracts change THEN type mismatches SHALL be detected at build time
3. WHEN new commands are added THEN type definitions SHALL be generated or validated automatically
4. IF manual type synchronization is required THEN there SHALL be clear processes and validation

### Requirement 6: Domain-Specific Testing Organization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want tests organized by domain so that I can easily run and maintain tests for specific functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN writing tests THEN they SHALL be co-located with the domain they test
2. WHEN running tests THEN I SHALL be able to run tests for specific domains independently
3. WHEN integration testing THEN cross-domain interactions SHALL have dedicated test suites
4. IF test utilities are shared THEN they SHALL be organized by domain or marked as shared utilities

### Requirement 7: Configuration and Data Management Alignment

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configuration and data files organized consistently so that I can easily understand data flow and dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration is needed THEN it SHALL be organized by domain and environment
2. WHEN default data is provided THEN it SHALL be co-located with the services that use it
3. WHEN data schemas change THEN both frontend and backend SHALL have synchronized definitions
4. IF data migration is needed THEN migration scripts SHALL be clearly organized and versioned

### Requirement 8: Clear Module Boundaries and Dependencies

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear module boundaries so that I can understand dependencies and avoid tight coupling.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN modules interact THEN dependencies SHALL be explicit and well-defined
2. WHEN circular dependencies exist THEN they SHALL be identified and resolved
3. WHEN adding new modules THEN dependency impact SHALL be clearly understood
4. IF cross-cutting concerns exist THEN they SHALL be properly abstracted and shared

## Current Structure Analysis

### Frontend Issues Identified
- Mixed organizational patterns (some by feature, some by technical layer)
- Service layer inconsistencies (some services are feature-specific, others are technical)
- Type definitions scattered across multiple files without clear domain boundaries
- Component organization doesn't align with backend domain structure

### Backend Issues Identified  
- Commands module mixes different abstraction levels
- Services module has both domain services and technical utilities
- Models module lacks clear domain grouping
- Inconsistent naming patterns between similar frontend/backend concepts

### Cross-Language Issues Identified
- No clear mapping between TypeScript services and Rust services
- Type definitions don't follow consistent patterns
- API contracts are defined in multiple places without single source of truth
- Testing organization doesn't align between frontend and backend

## Success Metrics

1. **Developer Velocity**: Reduce time to locate related functionality by 50%
2. **Code Maintainability**: Reduce cross-module dependencies by 30%
3. **Type Safety**: Achieve 100% type coverage for frontend-backend API contracts
4. **Testing Efficiency**: Enable domain-specific test execution with clear boundaries
5. **Onboarding Speed**: New developers can understand module organization within 1 day

## Constraints

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Changes must not break existing functionality
2. **Incremental Migration**: Structure improvements must be implementable incrementally
3. **Language Idioms**: Respect TypeScript and Rust language conventions
4. **Build System**: Changes must be compatible with existing Vite and Cargo build systems
5. **Tauri Integration**: Maintain compatibility with Tauri's command and event systems
