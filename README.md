## Quick Start Guide

### Using the Application

1. **Start the Application**:
   ```bash
   npm run tauri:dev
   # Or for production build
   npm run tauri:build
   ```

2. **Configure Apstra Connection** (Step 1):
   - Click "1. Apstra Connection" in the header or dashboard
   - Enter Apstra controller host, port, and credentials
   - **Authenticate and establish session** with connection testing
   - Specify blueprint name for provisioning and search operations

3. **Customize Conversion Mappings** (Step 2):
   - Click "2. Conversion Map" to customize Excel header mappings
   - Load default mappings or import custom configuration
   - Add, edit, or remove header-to-field mappings
   - Save custom configurations for reuse

4. **Provision Network Configuration** (Step 3):
   - Click "3. Provisioning" to start the provisioning workflow
   - Upload Excel file with network configuration data
   - Select sheet containing the data to process
   - Review parsed data in the interactive table
   - Execute provisioning after validation

5. **Use Search Tools** (Step 4):
   - Click "4. Tools" for **live Apstra API search capabilities**
   - **Search systems by name** with real-time results across blueprints
   - **Find IP addresses or CIDR ranges** with blueprint filtering
