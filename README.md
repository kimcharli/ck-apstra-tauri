## Quick Start Guide

### Using the Application

1. **Start the Application**:
   ```bash
   npm run tauri:dev
   # Or for production build
   npm run tauri:build
   ```

2. **Configure Apstra Connection** (Step 1):
   - Click "1. Apstra Connection" in the header or dashboard
   - Enter Apstra controller host, port, and credentials
   - Specify blueprint name for provisioning
   - Test connection to verify settings

3. **Customize Conversion Mappings** (Step 2):
   - Click "2. Conversion Map" to customize Excel header mappings
   - Load default mappings or import custom configuration
   - Add, edit, or remove header-to-field mappings
   - Save custom configurations for reuse

4. **Provision Network Configuration** (Step 3):
   - Click "3. Provisioning" to start the provisioning workflow
   - Upload Excel file with network configuration data
   - Select sheet containing the data to process
   - Review parsed data in the interactive table
   - Execute provisioning after validation

5. **Use Search Tools** (Step 4):
   - Click "4. Tools" for system and IP search capabilities
   - Search for specific systems by name across blueprints
   - Find IP addresses or CIDR ranges in network configurations
   - Manage blueprint operations (Leafs, Dump)

6. **Download Session Logs**:
   - Click the ðŸ“¥ button in the navigation header
   - Choose format (TXT, JSON, CSV) for log export
   - Use logs for troubleshooting and post-mortem analysis

### Supported Excel Formats

The application works with Excel files containing network configuration data. Default mappings support headers like:
- "Switch Name" â†’ switch_label
- "Port" â†’ switch_ifname  
- "Host Name" â†’ server_label
- "Speed (GB)" â†’ link_speed
- And many more...
